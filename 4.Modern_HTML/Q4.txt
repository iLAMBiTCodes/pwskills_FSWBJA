3 ways to improve the accessability in HTML:
1. By using Semantic tags we can add more meaningful structure to the user and hence navigation becomes easier.
2. By the use of alternative text for the images and other content, the user can get a idea about the content.
3. Using Aria tags can bring a lot of improvement in accessability.
