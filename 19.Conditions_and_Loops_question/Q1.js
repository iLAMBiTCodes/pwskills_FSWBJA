// Conditional Statements are used in programming language to execute a certain piece of code based on certain conditions. A program can run a block of code based on whether the condition is true or false.
// There are four types of conditional statement in JavaScript.
/*
1.if statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is flase, the block of code is skipped.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Block of code to be executed if condition is true
}

2.if-else statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true but executes another block of code if the condition if false.
Syntax: 
if (condition) {
    // Block of code to be executed if condition is true.
} else {
    // Block of code to be executed if condition is false.
}

3.if-else-if statement: It allows you to check for multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the the first condition that is true.
Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Block of code to be executed if condition1 is true.
} else if (condition2) {
    // Block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // BLock of code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false.
}

4.switch statement: It is used to execute different block of code based on different conditions. It provides a concise way to write multiple if-else statements.
Syntax:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value3
    break;
  // more cases can be added
  default:
    // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
