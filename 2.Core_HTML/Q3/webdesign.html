    <p align="center">So What is Web Designing? <br>Web Designing is the designing of websites. To become a web designer, one have to learn about Graphics design, layout designing, Interface designing, etc in order to improve user interface and get the user hooked to the website. <br>A Web Designer doesn't necessarily need the coding skills that a web developer does. Instead there are platforms with drag and drop feature which makes the works 10X easier.
    <h6 align="center">Hope <a href="https://pwskills.com/">PW Skills</a> brings an Web Designing course as well</h6>
