The key differences between Javascript and HTML are explained below:
1. JavaScript is a Programming Language whereas HTML is a markup language.
2.JavaScript provides dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing for interactivity and manipulation of content. HTMl describes the structure and content of web page.
3.Example use cases of JavaScript are: Handling user interactions(e.g, button clicks, form submissions), fetching data from the server, manipulating and updating DOM. Example use cases of HTML: Defining and structuring tables and elements, header elements, inserting media like images and videos, creating forms, etc

HTML would be helpful in giving overall structure to a webpage, whereas JavaScript would be helpful in giving interactivity to the elements of the same webpage. HTML would be helpful to add an image to a page whereas adding animation or effect to the image would require JavaScript.
