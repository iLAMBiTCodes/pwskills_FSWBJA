Comments are a important part in any programming including Javascript. It provides readability to the code. Comments can be given to the code to explain a particular line or piece of code which furthur can be used for code maintainability.

Single line comments are given followed by '//'
Example: let fruit = apple; //Assigning variable fruit with value apple

Multi line comments are written inside /*(which is one line) and */(which is on another).
Example: 
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
/*
Here we assign variable a = 5
Here we assign variable b = 10
*/
