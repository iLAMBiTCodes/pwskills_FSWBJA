Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for writing clear, understandable, and maintainable code.
Using clear identifiers one can improve code readability, maintainability, documentation, collaboration, bug preventation.

Using generic names, we get:
let l = 6; // length
let w = 9; // breadth

let result = a * b;

Using meaningful names, we get:
let length = 6; // length
let breadth = 9; // breadth

let areaOfRectangle = length * breadth;
